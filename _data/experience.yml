    In a team of student geophysicists and geologists, during the course of 3 weeks in New Mills, NB, we conducted several measurements pertaining to the master's thesis of Camille Hebert, under the supervision of Professor Bernd Milkreit. Tasks included:
	<ul>
  	<li>Magnetic susceptibility measurement from drill cores.</li>
  	<li>Identifying magnetically significant areas of interest and measuring their magnetic response using an Overhauser magnetometer.</li>
	</ul>
