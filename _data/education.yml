    I started my undergraduate degree as a Physics specialist, 
    however after my first I decided to pursue geophysics due 
    to my interest in earth sciences. During my final years 
    I was also interested in data science and computational physics. 

    During my free time I played soccer and volleyball in the intramural league!

    I have devoted my time to structural interpretation using geophysical data, 
    spatial analysis using GIS software, and prospectivity mapping using machine 
    learning on Python.
