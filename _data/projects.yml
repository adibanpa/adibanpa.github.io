    Geophysical surveying methods were utilizied on historical sites in 
    order to confirm settlement site, defensive structures, and burial 
    customs in Sechelt, BC. Following data collection, magnetic data was 
    processed using Matlab scripts. The resisitivity data was processed and 
    interpreted for undergraduate thesis.

    Collaborating with Dr. Rene E. Chavez on two different projects 
    using resistivity, magnetics, and GPR methods. Also computed 
    3D inversion of resistivity data using innovative electrode gridding systems
    developed by Dr. Charly Bank.
